; Error handling and logging ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; This directive informs PHP of which errors, warnings and notices you would like
; it to take action for. The recommended way of setting values for this
; directive is through the use of the error level constants and bitwise
; operators. The error level constants are below here for convenience as well as
; some common settings and their meanings.
; By default, PHP is set to take action on all errors, notices and warnings EXCEPT
; those related to E_NOTICE and E_STRICT, which together cover best practices and
; recommended coding standards in PHP. For performance reasons, this is the
; recommend error reporting setting. Your production server shouldn't be wasting
; resources complaining about best practices and coding standards. That's what
; development servers and development settings are for.
; Note: The php.ini-development file has this setting as E_ALL. This
; means it pretty much reports everything which is exactly what you want during
; development and early testing.
;
; Error Level Constants:
; E_ALL             - All errors and warnings
; E_ERROR           - fatal run-time errors
; E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR  - almost fatal run-time errors
; E_WARNING         - run-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
; E_PARSE           - compile-time parse errors
; E_NOTICE          - run-time notices (these are warnings which often result
;                     from a bug in your code, but it's possible that it was
;                     intentional (e.g., using an uninitialized variable and
;                     relying on the fact it is automatically initialized to an
;                     empty string)
; E_STRICT          - run-time notices, enable to have PHP suggest changes
;                     to your code which will ensure the best interoperability
;                     and forward compatibility of your code
; E_CORE_ERROR      - fatal errors that occur during PHP's initial startup
; E_CORE_WARNING    - warnings (non-fatal errors) that occur during PHP's
;                     initial startup
; E_COMPILE_ERROR   - fatal compile-time errors
; E_COMPILE_WARNING - compile-time warnings (non-fatal errors)
; E_USER_ERROR      - user-generated error message
; E_USER_WARNING    - user-generated warning message
; E_USER_NOTICE     - user-generated notice message
; E_DEPRECATED      - warn about code that will not work in future versions
;                     of PHP
; E_USER_DEPRECATED - user-generated deprecation warnings
;
; Common Values:
;   E_ALL (Show all errors, warnings and notices including coding standards.)
;   E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE  (Show all errors, except for notices)
;   E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT  (Show all errors, except for notices and coding standards warnings.)
;   E_COMPILE_ERROR|E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR|E_ERROR|E_CORE_ERROR  (Show only errors)
; Default Value: E_ALL
; Development Value: E_ALL
; Production Value: E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
; https://php.net/error-reporting
error_reporting = E_ALL

; This directive controls whether or not and where PHP will output errors,
; notices and warnings too. Error output is very useful during development, but
; it could be very dangerous in production environments. Depending on the code
; which is triggering the error, sensitive information could potentially leak
; out of your application such as database usernames and passwords or worse.
; For production environments, we recommend logging errors rather than
; sending them to STDOUT.
; Possible Values:
;   Off = Do not display any errors
;   stderr = Display errors to STDERR (affects only CGI/CLI binaries!)
;   On or stdout = Display errors to STDOUT
; Default Value: On
; Development Value: On
; Production Value: Off
; https://php.net/display-errors
display_errors = On

; The display of errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence are handled
; separately from display_errors. We strongly recommend you set this to 'off'
; for production servers to avoid leaking configuration details.
; Default Value: On
; Development Value: On
; Production Value: Off
; https://php.net/display-startup-errors
display_startup_errors = On

; Besides displaying errors, PHP can also log errors to locations such as a
; server-specific log, STDERR, or a location specified by the error_log
; directive found below. While errors should not be displayed on productions
; servers they should still be monitored and logging is a great way to do that.
; Default Value: Off
; Development Value: On
; Production Value: On
; https://php.net/log-errors
log_errors = On

; Do not log repeated messages. Repeated errors must occur in same file on same
; line unless ignore_repeated_source is set true.
; https://php.net/ignore-repeated-errors
ignore_repeated_errors = On

; Ignore source of message when ignoring repeated messages. When this setting
; is On you will not log errors with repeated messages from different files or
; source lines.
; https://php.net/ignore-repeated-source
ignore_repeated_source = Off

; If this parameter is set to Off, then memory leaks will not be shown (on
; stdout or in the log). This is only effective in a debug compile, and if
; error reporting includes E_WARNING in the allowed list
; https://php.net/report-memleaks
report_memleaks = On

; When PHP displays or logs an error, it has the capability of formatting the
; error message as HTML for easier reading. This directive controls whether
; the error message is formatted as HTML or not.
; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI
; https://php.net/html-errors
html_errors = On

; Log errors to specified file. PHP's default behavior is to leave this value
; empty.
; https://php.net/error-log
; Example:
error_log = ~/.dotfiles/log/php_error_log.log
; Log errors to syslog (Event Log on Windows).
;error_log = error_log

; The syslog ident is a string which is prepended to every message logged
; to syslog. Only used when error_log is set to syslog.
;syslog.ident = php

; The syslog facility is used to specify what type of program is logging
; the message. Only used when error_log is set to syslog.
;syslog.facility = user

; Set this to disable filtering control characters (the default).
; Some loggers only accept NVT-ASCII, others accept anything that's not
; control characters. If your logger accepts everything, then no filtering
; is needed at all.
; Allowed values are:
;   ascii (all printable ASCII characters and NL)
;   no-ctrl (all characters except control characters)
;   all (all characters)
;   raw (like "all", but messages are not split at newlines)
; https://php.net/syslog.filter
;syslog.filter = ascii

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Data Handling ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; This directive determines which super global arrays are registered when PHP
; starts up. G,P,C,E & S are abbreviations for the following respective super
; globals: GET, POST, COOKIE, ENV and SERVER. There is a performance penalty
; paid for the registration of these arrays and because ENV is not as commonly
; used as the others, ENV is not recommended on productions servers. You
; can still get access to the environment variables through getenv() should you
; need to.
; Default Value: "EGPCS"
; Development Value: "GPCS"
; Production Value: "GPCS";
; https://php.net/variables-order
variables_order = "GPCS"

; This directive determines which super global data (G,P & C) should be
; registered into the super global array REQUEST. If so, it also determines
; the order in which that data is registered. The values for this directive
; are specified in the same manner as the variables_order directive,
; EXCEPT one. Leaving this value empty will cause PHP to use the value set
; in the variables_order directive. It does not mean it will leave the super
; globals array REQUEST empty.
; Default Value: None
; Development Value: "GP"
; Production Value: "GP"
; https://php.net/request-order
request_order = "GP"

; This directive determines whether PHP registers $argv & $argc each time it
; runs. $argv contains an array of all the arguments passed to PHP when a script
; is invoked. $argc contains an integer representing the number of arguments
; that were passed when the script was invoked. These arrays are extremely
; useful when running scripts from the command line. When this directive is
; enabled, registering these variables consumes CPU cycles and memory each time
; a script is executed. For performance reasons, this feature should be disabled
; on production servers.
; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI
; Default Value: On
; Development Value: Off
; Production Value: Off
; https://php.net/register-argc-argv
register_argc_argv = Off

; When enabled, the ENV, REQUEST and SERVER variables are created when they're
; first used (Just In Time) instead of when the script starts. If these
; variables are not used within a script, having this directive on will result
; in a performance gain. The PHP directive register_argc_argv must be disabled
; for this directive to have any effect.
